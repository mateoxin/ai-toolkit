        # Multiple LoRAs with individual weights
        lora_paths:
          # First LoRA - Main character/subject (higher weight)
          - path: /path/to/your/character_lora.safetensors
            weight: 1.0
          
          # Second LoRA - Style or artistic effect (medium weight)
          - path: /path/to/your/style_lora.safetensors
            weight: 0.7
          
          # Third LoRA - Quality enhancement or subtle effect (optional, lower weight)
          # - path: /path/to/your/quality_lora.safetensors
          #   weight: 0.5
        
        # Note: If you omit 'weight', it defaults to 1.0
        # You can also use S3 paths:
        # - path: s3://bucket-name/path/to/lora.safetensors
        #   weight: 0.8

# Weight Recommendations:
# - Main subject/character LoRA: 0.8 - 1.0
# - Artistic style LoRA: 0.5 - 0.7
# - Quality enhancement LoRA: 0.3 - 0.5
# - Subtle effect LoRA: 0.2 - 0.4
